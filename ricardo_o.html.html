        <p>This is the way english was used for the project...<br>
        We use english to make a comparison between the foods made by the two cooking groups. 
        The groups 4°PAB-A and 4°PAB-B. Furthermore, we use english to make a comparative table.<br>
        <br>
        The themes we used were adjectives, adverbs and amparatives and superlatives.<br>
        <br>
        Let's remember that the dishes made were paninis and meat. In the case of the paninis, the comparison
        was as follow:

        <br>

        <p>Now let's talk of the relation that there between all with the english<br>

        the things that there to know in this career, programming, as this is full of terms in english.<br>
